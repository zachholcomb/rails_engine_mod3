## First clone the repository and then run the following commands:

1. bundle (if this fails, try to bundle update and then retry)
1. rails db:create && rails db:schema:load
1. bundle exec rake db:seed:from_csv

## Front End
To see rails_engine in action with a front end, clone this repository https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver and follow the setup steps in that ReadME.

REMINDER:  If you want to run rails_engine with the front end rails driver you will have to set it up following rails_driver's specifications!
